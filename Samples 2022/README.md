# Code samples 2022

Here are code samples from various projects that I've worked on during my time at Tecci, between 2021-2023.
Each folder holds code samples from different projects.
You can get links to the sites and pages from this README file, that shows the code in action and what they actually do.

Here's an explanation on what each folder holds.

<b>Google map form - Elfving Wordpress Theme component:</b>

This is a Google map form component from a Wordpress theme that I made and it is meant to be used to find different businesses around Finland that either sell or offer repairs for certain brands of vehicles. 
The buttons can be used to filter specific brands and services offered.
Since the Elfving theme is used on multiple sites (approximately 8), is has been designed in the way that its buttons can be styled a bit to fit different looking websites and also hide brand buttons, if the site is about one specific brand.
These businesses are stored in Wordpress as their own post type and contain the location coordinates and information regarding their services.

Here is a link to two different sites that use this component:
