# Code samples 2022

Here are code samples from various projects that I've worked on during my time at Tecci, between 2021-2023.
Each folder holds code samples from different projects.
You can get links to the sites and pages from this README file, that shows the code in action and what they actually do.

Here's an explanation on what each folder holds.

<b>Google map form - Elfving Wordpress Theme component:</b>

This is a Google map form component from a Wordpress theme that I made and it is meant to be used to find different businesses around Finland that either sell or offer repairs for certain brands of vehicles. 
The buttons can be used to filter specific brands and services offered.
Since the Elfving theme is used on multiple sites (approximately 8), is has been designed in the way that its buttons can be styled a bit to fit different looking websites and also hide brand buttons, if the site is about one specific brand.
These businesses are stored in Wordpress as their own post type and contain the location coordinates and information regarding their services.

Here is a link to two different sites that use this component:

<b>History gallery - Lauritzon site component:</b>

This component is a simple gallery, that holds images and text and arranges them horizontally side by side, but change the placement of the image and text vertically between sets. This content can be easily cycled through by utilising the buttons in the center between the image and text area, which will move the view to the next text and image set when clicked, but if the user scrolls through the content, the button set moves automatically with them, so the button are never lost for the user.
The content itself comes from Wordpress and is then displayed on the website.

Here is a link to the page that utilises this component on the Lauritzon website. The component is after the title component:

<b>Player controller - from my final thesis project for my studies at Metropolia:</b>

This is part of a playable character in Unity engine I made regarding my final thesis project for my studies. The code shows the logic regarding how its movement is made and controlled by the user. It contains calculations and checks regarding its movement logic within the game world.
The project this was used for was a small 3D platformer, where the user had to navigate simple 3D spaces and obstacles to beat the game and was meant to study video game literacy of the user who was playing it.

Here is a link to a video showcasing it in action:
