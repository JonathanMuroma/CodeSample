# ExampleCodeSamples
Code samples from various projects.

Here are codes from various projects that I've worked on.
Each folder holds code samples from different projects and an README file, which has explanations regarding what the purpose of the code is and where it is from.
The README file will also hold links to videos showcasing how the code works in the actual project. The video files are also inside the folders just in case.
