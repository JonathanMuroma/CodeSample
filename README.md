# Code samples

This repo contains small snippets of code samples from different projects I've worked on. Most of them from web development, but also some from game development

I've separated these samples to their own folders and those folders by years, so to see the samples of my most recent work, all you need to do is check the most recent year folder to find them.

Each year folder also contain a README file, which hold descriptions and explanations about the samples they hold and links to either videos or sites that showcase said code samples working and what they actually do.
